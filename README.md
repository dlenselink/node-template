# General Purpose Node Template

This template provides a good starting point for any Node.js application.

## Pre-Requisites

Before attempting to set up the project for the first time, ensure that you have successfully installed the following utilities. If not, install them in the following order:

- [ ] [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - **[Install NodeJS here](https://nodejs.org/en/)** for all operating systems.

- [ ] [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) - Install **npx** with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g npx
```

## First Time Setup

### 1) Update dev dependencies

**Open a terminal with this project as the working directory. Then, run the following command and follow the instructions in any ensuing prompts:**

```bash
npx npm-check-updates
```

### 2) Install all dependencies

**In that same terminal (or any terminal with this project as the current working directory), run the following command:**

```bash
npm i
```

**This will download and install the node_modules dependencies for the few dev dependencies this template uses.**

### 3) Copy `Prettier` config

**In the vscode explorer window, right-click the `.prettierrc.json` file and copy its file path.**
