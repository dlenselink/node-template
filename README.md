# General Purpose Node Template

This template provides a good starting point for any Node.js application.

## Pre-Requisites

Before attempting to set up the project for the first time, ensure that you have successfully installed the following utilities. If not, install them in the following order:

- [ ] [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - **[Install NodeJS here](https://nodejs.org/en/)** for all operating systems.

- [ ] [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) - Install **npx** with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g npx
```

## First Time Setup

### 4)

- [ ] **Update dev dependencies**

Open a terminal with this project as the working directory. Then, run the following command and follow the instructions in any ensuing prompts:

```bash
npx npm-check-updates
```

### 5)

- [ ] **Install all dependencies**

In that same terminal (or any terminal with this project as the current working directory), run the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

This will download and install the node_modules dependencies for the few static dev dependencies this template uses. You are now ready to modify the code and run the app! To run the app, just run:

```bash
npm start
```
